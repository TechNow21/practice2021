			<h1><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h1>
			<h2>Semester Project: Examples of Previous Work</h2>
            <p>I have provided links to six of the pictures of the work I completed this semester. The links for each example at the top of the page and labeled accordingly.</p>
			<p>I resized the pictures that were over 800 px to make them smaller before I put them in the site. The ones that were alrealy under 800 px remained the same.</p>
			<p>I used Dreamweaver to create these web pages. Each picture that required a before and after have been provided. The first images are the before and were labeled "original" and the last is the after, labeled here as "final". </p>
			<p>This was an enjoyable semester because I was able to learn Photoshop and the way it brings creativity out. The projects I worked on were relevant and fun. I know that I have a lot to learn, but in the meantime I hope I can continue applying what I learn in future projects.</p>

                <p>I chose a brief description of each example. Outlining general points of what I did to each photograph or canvas.</p>

                <h3>WHY DID I CHOOSE THESE EXAMPLES?</h3>
                <p>I chose these examples because I actually like the way the ended up.</p>
